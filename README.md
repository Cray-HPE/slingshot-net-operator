# csm-template

Template for CSM repositories including basic files. This README is also...a template.

See the suggested sections below, adapted from https://www.makeareadme.com/. Not all sections will make sense for all projects, use your best judgment.


# Project Name

_Choose a self-explaining name for your project._

## Description

_Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors._

_If this repo is around only for historical purposes and the project is no longer used, state that in the TOP of the README._

## Getting Started

_This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps._

_Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible._ 

### Prerequisites

_If your project only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Prerequisites subsection._

### Installation

### Usage

_Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples in official documentation if they are too long to reasonably include in the README._

_Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method._

## Compatibility

_List the versions of the project and their associated dependencies and any other compatibility information. A table is often the easiest way to communicate compatibility information. The [Kubernetes python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility) is a good example._

## Support

_Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, official documentation, etc._

* [Slack Channel(s)]
* [Admin or installation guide section]
* [CSM SIG group discussions in Cray-HPE/community repository]

## Roadmap (optional)

_If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to provide links to the roadmap, wherever they reside (CASMFEAT-###)._
